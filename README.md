# Arch-Linux-Install 
A simple arch linux install guide for laptops with wifi connection. (UEFI-mode only).


Make sure you read through the [Arch install guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) before following my document.

This install guide does not cover any of the drivers installation like _trackpad_ and stuff.

**_I made this install guide because it suits me but it might not work for you, so be sure to try it in VM first_**
